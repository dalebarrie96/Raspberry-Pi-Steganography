# Raspberry Pi Steganography

## About This Project

Recently iv been spending a lot of time looking into cryptography and steganography and its got me thinking of some new projects. I love the idea of turning a raspberry pi into an enigma type machine where only two identically configured pi's would be able to extract the hidden messages. I originally planned on making this work exactly like an enigma machine(possibly coming soon), but decided with modern tech, a modern form of hiding messages (steganography) would be more appropriate. The concept is pretty simple, two identically setup pi's would listen for new storage devices. once one is inserted it would then look at the files on the device and either hide or reveal the hidden messages. Realistically the practicality of this project is pretty low, however it gives me some good hands on experience of the stuff i have been researching.
